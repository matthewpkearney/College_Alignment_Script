# College_Alignment_Script
A Python script that collects attributes and analyzes data based on ranking important criteria in choosing an educational institution to reveal the programs that align best with the user's interests. Idea: turn this into a web-development project, allowing more people to use it with overall better functionality. 


# Reason:
I created a script with an identical purpose to this in my senior year of high school, without knowing it was truly relevant work in the field I was aspiring to join. It really helped me to consider my priorities coming into college and ultimately end up at the school that I did.

I wanted to recreate this script a second time in a more friendly and versatile way so that more people can use it, and to give more background to my interest in using software projects to solve big problems


# Intended purpose:
While I would NOT recommend using this script as an end-all-be-all to your decision, the script does have an especially fantastic use case for people who are still in the chaotic midst of their decision.

Everyone will have different criteria they are considering when choosing a college. This script is very versatile because you can easily add an attribute that is important to you in your decision, and specify the amount of weight the factor holds. The intended purpose is to make the criteria in this script align with what you are looking for. Once you have deciphered the factor's importance in your decision and the weight of each factor, you can reveal an order ranking of the colleges that match your interests best by running the script.
